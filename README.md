# Running this project:

To get this project up and running you should start by having Python installed on your computer. It's advised you create a virtual environment to store your projects dependencies separately. You can install virtualenv with

      pip install virtualenv

Clone or download this repository and open it in your editor of choice. In a terminal (mac/linux) or windows terminal, run the following command in the base directory of this project

      virtualenv env

That will create a new folder env in your project directory. Next activate it with this command on mac/linux:

      source env/bin/active

Then install the project dependencies with

      pip install -r requirements.txt

Now you can run the project with this command

      python manage.py runserver

Note if you want payments or email or sms to work you will need to enter your own Stripe API keys into the .env file in the settings files.
